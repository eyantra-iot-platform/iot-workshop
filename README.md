# iot-workshop 2018
This repository contains resources for e-Yantra IoT Workshops. The workshops teach IoT and how to use IoT Platform to 
build IoT Applications. 

You can use these resources to learn IoT development in general, understand AWS IoT and learn to use [IoT Platform](https://github.com/E-yantra/iot-platform) to build IoT applications. [e-Yantra Iot Platform](https://github.com/E-yantra/iot-platform) is an open source IoT framework that acts as a wrapper around AWS IoT to make developing IoT applications even easier. You can either set it up yourself or use [our hosted server](http://iot.e-yantra.com).  

Even though the resources are built around [e-Yantra IoT Platform](https://github.com/E-yantra/iot-platform), the same principles can be easily applied elsewhere.



#### All resources are divided into 3 parts:
1. #### [Introduction to IoT](./intro-to-iot)

    Notes, interactive exercises and sample codes for learning and understanding IoT itself, its stack and different IoT Protocols.

2. #### [AWS IoT](./aws-iot)

    Notes, pictures, demos and examples for undestanding AWS IoT architecture, device shadow and AWS IoT rules.
    
3. #### [e-Yantra IoT Platform](./iot-platform)

    Notes, pictures, code samples and walk throughs to connect to IoT Platform and exchange data. It will also show how to use 
    different features of the Platform like crons, nlp interface, visualization and control of actuators. Resources are available 
    for different platforms like RPi with Python, Mongoose OS, Nodejs, etc. Will also contain codes for applications that you build 
    as part of the workshop on hardware provided by e-Yantra.
