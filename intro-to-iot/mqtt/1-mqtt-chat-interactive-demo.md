## Interactive demo for understanding MQTT

We will be using [**node-mqtt**](https://github.com/manjrekarom/node-mqtt) which is an application that uses MQTT for communication. It uses Mosca MQTT broker and MQTT.js in browser, and communicates with MQTT over Websockets protocol. 

You can clone the **node-mqtt** repository yourself if you wish to try it out. Instructions for installing the application and its dependencies are given in its respective [repository](https://github.com/manjrekarom/node-mqtt).
