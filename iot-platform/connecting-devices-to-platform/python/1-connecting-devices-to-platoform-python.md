## Connecting devices to IoT platform with python

You will learn to connect your device, that supports python, to IoT Platform(~AWS IoT). 

We will be using one of the popular devices out there which is Raspberry Pi. But please note that the procedure is going to remain  
the same as long as you are using Python.

**NOTE:** We will be using information like certificate pairs, thingID, etc. This becomes available after you create a thing in IoT Platform.
For instructions on how to do it please see [*Using IoT Platform*]().
